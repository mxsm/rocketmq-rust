```

**Run Clippy**

```
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace

```

**Run all tests:**

```

**Submit Pull Request**

- Send a pull request to the main branch.
- The mentor will do code review before discussing some details (including the design, the implementation and the
  performance) with you. The request will be merged into the branch of current development version after the edit is
  well enough.
