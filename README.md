# rocketmq-rust

 Welcome to [Apache Rocketmq](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq) Rust implementation (Unofficial ). **RocketMQ-Rust** is a reimplementation of the Apache RocketMQ message middleware in the Rust language. This project aims to provide Rust developers with a high-performance and reliable message queue service, making full use of the features of the Rust language.

### RocketMQ-Rust Features

- **Rust Language Advantages:** Leveraging the benefits of Rust, such as memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and high concurrency performance, RocketMQ-Rust offers an efficient and reliable message middleware.
- **Asynchronous and Non-blocking Design:** RocketMQ-Rust takes full advantage of Rust's asynchronous programming capabilities, adopting a non-blocking design that supports high-concurrency message processing.
- **Ecosystem Integration:** As part of the Rust ecosystem, RocketMQ-Rust integrates well with other libraries and frameworks within the Rust ecosystem, providing flexible integration options for developers.
- **Cross-platform Support:** RocketMQ-Rust supports multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, macOS, making it convenient for use in different environments.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

1. rust toolchain MSRV is 1.75.(stable,nightly)

### Run name server

**Run the following command to see usageï¼š**

- **windows platform**

  ```cmd
  cargo run --bin rocketmq-namesrv-rust -- --help
  
  RocketMQ Name server(Rust)
  
  Usage: rocketmq-namesrv-rust.exe [OPTIONS]
  
  Options:
    -p, --port <PORT>  rocketmq name server port [default: 9876]
    -i, --ip <IP>      rocketmq name server ip [default: 127.0.0.1]
    -h, --help         Print help
    -V, --version      Print version
  ```

- **Linux platform**

  ```shell
  $ cargo run --bin rocketmq-namesrv-rust -- --help
  
  RocketMQ Name server(Rust)
  
  Usage: rocketmq-namesrv-rust [OPTIONS]
  
  Options:
    -p, --port <PORT>  rocketmq name server port [default: 9876]
    -i, --ip <IP>      rocketmq name server ip [default: 127.0.0.1]
    -h, --help         Print help
    -V, --version      Print version
  ```

Run the following command to start the name server

```shell
cargo run --bin rocketmq-namesrv-rust
```

## Modules

The existing RocketMQ has the following functional modules:

- **Name Server**
- **Broker**
- **Store (Local Storage)**
- **Controller (High Availability)**
- **Client (SDK)**
- **Proxy**
- **Tiered Store (Tiered Storage Module)**

The specific functions of each module can be referred to in the [official RocketMQ documentation](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/develop/docs). The Rust implementation will be carried out sequentially in the following order.

## Name Server

| Get name server config                 | 318          | :broken_heart: |        |

Other module implementations will be done subsequently, starting with the Rust implementation of the Name Server. The goal is to achieve functionality similar to the Java version.
