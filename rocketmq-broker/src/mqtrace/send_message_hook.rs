/// The `SendMessageHook` trait defines a common interface for sending messages.

/// This trait is composed of three methods:
/// - `hook_name`: Returns a string slice that represents the name of the hook.
/// - `send_message_before`: Called before a message is sent. It takes a reference to a
///   `SendMessageContext`.
/// - `send_message_after`: Called after a message is sent. It also takes a reference to a
///   `SendMessageContext`.
