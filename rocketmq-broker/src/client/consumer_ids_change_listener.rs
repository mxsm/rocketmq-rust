/// Trait for listening to consumer ID changes.

/// consumer group. Implementors of this trait can react to consumer group events, handle them, and
/// perform necessary actions such as resource cleanup during shutdown.

    /// Handles consumer group events.

    /// This method is called when a consumer group event occurs, allowing the implementor to react
    /// to changes in consumer IDs. It can be used to update internal state or perform actions
    /// based on the event.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    /// * `event` - The consumer group event that occurred.
    /// * `group` - The name of the consumer group affected by the event.
    /// * `args` - Additional arguments or context provided with the event.
