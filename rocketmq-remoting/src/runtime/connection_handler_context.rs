/// Shared mutable context for request handlers.
///
/// This type alias wraps `ConnectionHandlerContextWrapper` in an `ArcMut` to allow
/// efficient sharing and mutation across async tasks. Handlers receive this context
/// and use it to access the channel and send responses.
pub type ConnectionHandlerContext = ArcMut<ConnectionHandlerContextWrapper>;

/// Request handler context - provides access to the channel for a specific connection.
///
/// `ConnectionHandlerContextWrapper` is the execution context passed to request processors.
/// It encapsulates the channel associated with the incoming request, allowing handlers to:
///
/// - **Send responses**: Via `write()` or `write_ref()`
/// - **Access connection metadata**: Remote address, connection state
/// - **Perform advanced operations**: Direct connection access if needed
///
/// ## Design Rationale
///
/// - **Thin wrapper**: Delegates most operations to the underlying `Channel`
/// - **Hash/Eq based on channel**: Contexts for the same channel are equal
/// - **Wrapped in ArcMut**: Shared across async tasks, enables interior mutability
///
/// ## Naming Note
///
/// The "Wrapper" suffix indicates this is the concrete type wrapped by the
/// `ConnectionHandlerContext` type alias. It's rarely used directly - prefer
/// using the type alias in function signatures.
